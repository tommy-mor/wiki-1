``There are wavelengths that people cannot see, there are sounds that people cannot hear, and maybe computers have thoughts that people cannot think.''

Shannon information theory?

Hired as a clerk for the computers of people like Feynman and Shannon. Kept asking 'why?'


you must first tell yourself that you'd like to do something significant

there is always repitition we see in people who make impacts, like Shannon. Partly luck but the only control we have over that is our circumstances

great work is not just 'brains'; often the issue is with articulation, a lack of an ability to access the language and forum necessary to develop ideas

once you've developed the courage to face - and solve - important problems, you can - he postulates that this will lead to a stream of successes if you stick to the method

the best stem work is often done early in the career while the best literary work is often done late

do not define your scale by the problems you've faced, Shannon error
