Git is a popular version control system.

* Tricks

* Writing a Git Commit Message
[[https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/][Article Reference]]

- Concise and consistent length and form
- Communicate clear context about a change to fellow developers.
  Ensure that other developers understand *why* a change was made.
** Rules
- Separate subject from body with a blank line
  if the body is to be used.
- Limit subject line to 50 characters
- Capitalize subject line
- Do not end with period
- Use imperative mood; I 'do' this.
  Rationale: If applied, the commit will change these aspects of the code.
  Git's own built-in conventions use this form.
- Wrap at 72 characters
- Use the body to explain 'what' and 'why' as necessary

* Repositories
- GitHub :: I use this; Microsoft is bad but the community is good
- Sourcehut :: Minimal free software repository. I would use this if the developer weren't an egotistical BDFL.
- Gitea :: Open source git repository; self host it

* Organization Thoughts
github organization:
- one repo per course - as most courses require partner work
= repo for coding challenge practice problems
- managing research notes: ??? i am thinking a single org file for all of this
- - that is, an org file in each project for the research notes pertaining to that project,
- - and anotherorg file for misc. research ?? i will have to see how my research is used

* Rewriting
It's a good idea to reformat commits to make them more readable.
#+begin_src sh
git reset HEAD~${number of commits to go back}
#+end_src

** Patch previous commits with rebases
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9103396/how-do-i-edit-a-previous-git-commit
If you need to change commit history:
- Make another commit to make the change
- Rebase starting at the commit you want to change
- Squash the new commit with the old one in the history
- Remove the second commit message (or merge it...)
This did change the commit time for my latest commit, which is something to watch out for.
