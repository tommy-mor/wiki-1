Bowman @wilbowma@mastodon.social on Twitter: &quot;Last time, asked students to prove the empty set is not equal to the set containing the empty set. This time, I asked them to prove 1 is not equal to 0. This was by mistake. Thankfully, has resulted in a most pedantic discussion about whether we know conjunction is commutative.&quot; / Twitter]]

** category theory

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kleisli_category -- category for monads
Does every monad arise from an adjunction?
 http://comonad.com/reader/ -- curry howard lambek currespondence guides researchers into computation. rea    ding a logic like type theory is a definitional trick as it is just reinterpretation of syntax. syntactic     categories are difficult to connect to categorical semantics
