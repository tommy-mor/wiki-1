#+title: Terminal UI

A Terminal UI, or TUI, is a user interface
that can be manipulated in the terminal,
but that is not interacted with via shell commands.

Programs with a Terminal UI are written to function
without the use of a graphical user interface,
enabling easy access to desktop environments with
tools such as SSH.

Some choose to use their system in an entirely
TUI-based fashion with programs such as vim, mutt and tmux.
Unfortunately, many websites and web-based programs
are not usable without a graphical user interface,


* Terminal improvements
