Emacs is a fully-featured programming environment.

It's often (or most commonly) referred to as a text editor,
but this isn't the case. Other editors are designed to offer first-class
interfaces for configuring keyboard shortcuts, text configurations, etc.

However, emacslisp is structured not to be used as an editor configuration
with some additional logic capabilities, but rather as a fully-featured
programming language with proper language facilities.

Emacs is my desktop environment. [[file:./exwm.org][EXWM]] was my window manaager,
elfeed is my RSS reader, mu4e is my email client and so forth.
The one program that does not have a proper Emacs interface
is the web browser, so I use Firefox (and web apps) for most other tools.

This isn't to cause myself undue pain. It reduces context switching between the keyboard shortcuts of many programs and their keybindings,
and allows time tracking, task tracking and information management
(all fractured, often difficult concepts) to be managed by [[file:./org_mode.org][Org Mode]] entirely within Emacs. This tight integration allows me to take notes and track time without having to switch contexts to other programs with other
user interfaces.
