** 23:11 last day of internship
i didn't complete anything and i'm not proud of my work
i was going to be offered an extension to continue working
i am depressed
im not sure what that interaction with caleb was at the end
where i talked to his wife (cant remember her name lol) and
he had some look with her and she said we were just talking.
what does that mean? why?
i dont understand what someone else would see in my work
or what i was really expected to do
