Small ideas for hackathons or small periods of time.

These will each be eventually updated with their own posts as the ideas expand and they're given names.

The name is the most important part of a project. Without a good name the project will fail.


## Reddit Tree Navigation {#reddit-tree-navigation}

Remember Prezi? You could click on different bubbles
to navigate through a presentation nonlinearly, or could
navigate it linearly with forward and backwards arrow keys.

This has a lot of potential! Let's try it with Reddit threads.


### UX {#ux}

Visiting a reddit post and prefixing it with the reddit tree website's URL opens a window with the post's contents at the top of the webpage. Below this, there are lots of bubbles pseudorandomly scattered throughout the page. Their sizes are by default weighted by the number of upvotes on the comment, but they can be arranged by number of comments in the thread branching from the comment or some other metrics (TBD).

Each bubble has the username, number of upvotes, and the prefix of the comment. They may have smaller bubbles visible to demonstrate the next layer of comments in the tree.

Clicking on one of these bubbles does one of two things (not sure yet):

-   Moves the bubble to the top right of the screen
-   Replaces the text of the reddit post with that of the comment opened

Either way, the user now has access to a back button to go 'back up' in the tree (we define clicking on a bubble as 'going down' the tree), and they also can see all of the comments descended from the currently open comment as first-class bubbles.

Each of these pages will also havte a bubble with a plus sign on it in the bottom right of the page; clicking this opens a bubble that fills most of the screen, with the comment or post you're commenting on featured as a smaller bubble above it (perhaps it's visible as a semicircle under this bubble?). You can then make a reddit comment using the usual reddit facilities for this.


### Production {#production}


#### MVP {#mvp}

-   Visit a specific url on the reddit tree view website to open a reddit thread.
-   View the post and each comment in a bubble.
-   Click a bubble to view the next level of comments.


#### Enhanced UX {#enhanced-ux}

-   Tree view can be accessed by prefixing a reddit URL thread with our URL.
-   Post bubbles are sized proportionally to their number of upvotes or some other ranking metric. You can see smaller bubbles around them that provide an estimate of the number of comments in their assoc. thread.


#### Usable for Reddit {#usable-for-reddit}

-   The user can log in and make comments themselves.


#### Complete Product {#complete-product}

Rather than providing alternate views to individual threads, the program can instead act as its own reddit client.

The main page of the site functions just like Reddit's home page, only with bubbles for each subreddit.
The bubbles are weighted proportional to the number of new posts, popularity of those posts or some other metric.

When clicking on one of these subreddit bubbles, you open a secondary bubble view that showcases each post in the subreddit.
A UI is provided to make new posts in the subreddit from this page.

Clicking on an individual posts opens the fleshed out idea above, providing an alternative navigational experience for all of reddit.


## Version Control for Music {#version-control-for-music}

Live coding is a good idea, but it's meant to be 'played';
current solutions for persisting livecoding information require
recording, which compresses all of the structural information associated with the music, or meticulously copying and pasting code then saving it all.

We can do better!

A 'recording' mode for a live coding environment could be implemented.

To start the recording mode, a new branch is created.
Every time the file is updated and re-run, it's recorded as a git commit in a project's commit history.
The commit message has notation demonstrating how long a certain commit was played (time from start of recording to first commit or from the last commit to the current one).

When done recording, you can switch back to the main branch. The new branches are identified by a particular notation in the branch name to demonstrate that they were automatically created.

These recordings can be:

-   Played back. A menu is exposed to 'play' each of the created branches.
    When a branch is played, its first commit is run through the music interpreter for a specified amount of time, then the new commit is checked out and re-run; this is identical to a user manually editing the file and updating the played music, and tracks will only update if the code has been changed for them.
-   Exported: this can be done in the same way tracks are played back.
-   Converted to linear tracks. You can 'export' a branch to a linear arrangement to make it easier to edit and turn into a complete song without having to record it! This process generates the appropriate pauses in between the different parts of the music and loops to ensure that the different segments of the track are run at the right time and in the right order.
    This allows artists to take live coding projects that have been performed. convert them into full-fledged tracks, and export them without having to perform them.


## Spell Check Hook {#spell-check-hook}

I hate improper spelling or formatting.
A linter that checks for proper spelling in a project with git hooks!
You won't be able to commit to your projecct until you fix those spelling errors.


## GitHub README Information Generators {#github-readme-information-generators}

These are tools dynamically queried by README files that show information about specific projects.
They're lightweight and easily hosted.
<https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats> is a good place to start for learning how to make one such banner.

Look into dynamically configuring and formatting text via a specific web query. Perhaps a server can be made to accept arbitrary html/css and output an image with this information?

I'll also need a tool for converting such a file into a URL-compatible version, see <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1547899/which-characters-make-a-url-invalid#1547940>.


## ETC {#etc}

configure keybindings for multiple programs at once
'compile' to assign comprehensive keybindings to all utilities
single point of control
friendly, easy to use configuration
langauge that can 'target' differnet things

web search from terminal
web search from rofi or something that just comes up that i can type into

for projectional editing: provide clear auditory indications of different program behaviors to alarm us
eg wiring up jenkins to unsuccessful deployments on different pipelines, different sounds for different themes

pluggable sound system with insertable sound effects; able to hear two events occuring at identical intervals but it is difficult to see this in terms of time stamps!

## learning from casual friends {#learning-from-casual-friends}

-   find the person at the office who knows things and buy them a beer!

become friends with amazing programmers. care about them and listen to their frustrations
we have lots of 'tribal knowledge' that comes out but that we do not fully understand or internalize

making sense of all of the information :: mandate making content. to make this content, you have to first learn -- really understand -- the content. to take an online class, you work towards some certification or end goal with which yuo can demonstrate the work. always do something to add to github at least. if you produce more, you will always learn more

do not need to be good at all of the things; find a balance between being average in many topics and good in a few topics. getting a job means you know enough about enough! bounce around and learn more about more until you find something that really sticks.

one of the best ways to learn a tool is by using it at work -- you're mandated to use it.get a job to learn the thing you want to learn! it's not possible to do **everything** in your spare time, after all
solve problems around you without asking permission


### three steps {#three-steps}

[sdl](https://www.jjude.com/sdl/)
consume, produce and engage.
first, lookfor the best articles, books videos on the topic and devour them
then produce something -- blog post, slides, illustration to contextualize the learning
finally, share with others get feedback and perfect the opinion. can now make closet to a complete picture

keep a running google doc; append anything interesting to it. go back to it every once and awhile to reinforce the ideas!

blog :: keep **logs** of different categories and ideas. expand them as needed.
by always working on the most interesting problem available, you have endless motivation. with this motivation you will not have incentive to quit! find the passion.
thomas huxkey -- a good liberal education is to know something about everything and everything about something. go deep on what you want to work in but become broad in skills with everything else.


## couchsurfing {#couchsurfing}

stay at strangers place entirely for free
anything you ant it t be -- fill out profile with detail and you can pick out whoever you want to host
get ot meet incredible people and bring incredible people into ur home as both a host and proprietor!
try this when u move off campus to see who u can meet . if its still around

crossing the red line :: going from a basic feeling to a constant frustration, beyond such a frustration to this feeling that you can do much more than you thought you could do. the mind accepts even as the body tires, and that the mind has no use -- you are now mind over matter, and can keep going if you need to because you've triumphed!

find alone time while off work
go for a drive at least once a day
make sure to have a sit down meal with family

the most important thing to do is to avoid thinking about work when you are not doing it

think of someone you love but do not see often. how many more times will you be able to see that person? how important is each of those meetings?

computers are useless.they only give you answers. pablo picasso
i refuse to do anything that computers can do - olin shivers

think of meat as a side dish, not as a meal


## naval adv {#naval-adv}

no skill called business
study micro, game theory, psych, persuasion, ethics, math and computers
reading is faster than listening, doing is faster than watching
too busy to do coffee but uncluttered calendar
enforce aspirational hourly rate, outsource if it makes sense
work as hard as you can. even though who you work with and what you work on are more important
become the best at what you do. keep redefining what you do until this is true.
there are no grq schemes
apply specific knowledge with leverage and eventually you will get what you deserve
;once upon a time mtg

take a couple of notes -- write a couple of sentences -- about the small things every day. money exchanged? what happened?

hacking signs :: access panel protected by small lock. keyboard attached by curly cord with keyboard. programming is scrolling to instant text, then typing what  you want to display and clicking run without save or adding pages to it. hacket tips :: DOTS is the default password. if password changed, hold control and shift, and enter DIPY while holding, then resets the password to DOTS
