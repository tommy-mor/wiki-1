#+title: Org Mode
Org Mode is a markup language and a part of the Emacs ecosystem.
It's a favorite of developers, writers, and researchers alike,
and is often used for literate programming.

This wiki, along with all of my other notes, is drafted entirely
in org-mode and rendered through a static site generator.

[[https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/][This post]] and [[https://orgmode.org/][the emacs docs]] are incredibly helpful for documentation.

* Basic Formatting
The structure of an org-mode file is intuitive.
#+begin_src org
: * Heading 1
: ** Heading 2
: *** Heading 3
: *** And so forth...
#+end_src

It supports several flavors of text:
#+begin_src org
,*bold*, /italic/, _underlined_, +strikethrough+, =monospace=.

Links are rendered [[https://jacob.chvatal.com][with description]]
or without: https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only/

Lists can be
- ordered
  - have sub-headings
    1. support enumeration
    2. as needed
- have definitions :: true.
+ works as well
- [ ] can be unfinished
- [X] or complete

: or rendered as preformatted text.
#+end_src

#+begin_src python
def logical():
    return f'Org mode can also'
           f'render code from many languages!'
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh
echo "it supports any language that is supported by Emacs"
#+end_src

#+begin_src python :exports both
return "and can even display the result of evaluated code!"
print("Sometimes...")
#+end_src

| It Contains | Great Tables |
|-------------+--------------|
| 42          | With         |
| Native      | Support!     |

It has a single standard, and isn't a 'flavor' of markdown or rst!

* Plugins
The best part about org mode isn't its simplicity and flexibility --
its that it has become an integral component of the Emacs ecosystem.

With this, the format has seen support for many tools -- from calendar
to todo lists and READMEs to DevOps, it's flexible enough to be used
anywhere -- and thrives in the right ecosystem.
