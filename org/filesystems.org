#+TITLE: File Systems

File systems are pretty cool, they manage how you interact with your files.
You can interface with new file systems without modifying your kernel by using FUSE.
I use ext4 at the moment, but a future install of my operating system will make use of BtrFS or ZFS to provide automatic backups and rollbacks, potentially using RAID to preserve information across zpools.
